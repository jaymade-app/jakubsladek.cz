    "about.bio_1": "Hey! I'm Jakub. I build things for the web and lately, I've been deep into making AI actually useful in real products. I work across the full stack, from Rust backends to Next.js frontends, and I care a lot about writing code that's clean and maintainable.",
    "about.bio_2": "I got into programming back in 2018, tinkering with Steam bots in Node.js. From there I went through the corporate world writing PHP (Laravel, Nette), but eventually went independent to work on things I genuinely care about. Right now I'm building <a href='https://rozhybejfoto.cz' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>rozhybejfoto.cz</a>, a service that brings photos to life with AI, and running <a href='https://jaymade.app' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>jaymade.app</a> as my personal tech lab.",
    "about.bio_3": "When I'm not coding, I'm usually running trails or experimenting with biohacking. I find that getting outside is the best way to untangle a hard problem. Most of my best ideas come mid-run.",
